/**
 * A Cargo. This is the central class in the domain model,
 * and it is the root of the Cargo-Itinerary-Leg-Delivery-RouteSpecification aggregate.
 *
 * A cargo is identified by a unique tracking id, and it always has an origin
 * and a route specification. The life cycle of a cargo begins with the booking procedure,
 * when the tracking id is assigned. During a (short) period of time, between booking
 * and initial routing, the cargo has no itinerary.
 *
 * The booking clerk requests a list of possible routes, matching the route specification,
 * and assigns the cargo to one route. The route to which a cargo is assigned is described
 * by an itinerary.
 *
 * A cargo can be re-routed during transport, on demand of the customer, in which case
 * a new route is specified for the cargo and a new route is requested. The old itinerary,
 * being a value object, is discarded and a new one is attached.
 *
 * It may also happen that a cargo is accidentally misrouted, which should notify the proper
 * personnel and also trigger a re-routing procedure.
 *
 * When a cargo is handled, the status of the delivery changes. Everything about the delivery
 * of the cargo is contained in the Delivery value object, which is replaced whenever a cargo
 * is handled by an asynchronous event triggered by the registration of the handling event.
 *
 * The delivery can also be affected by routing changes, i.e. when a the route specification
 * changes, or the cargo is assigned to a new route. In that case, the delivery update is performed
 * synchronously within the cargo aggregate.
 *
 * The life cycle of a cargo ends when the cargo is claimed by the customer.
 *
 * The cargo aggregate, and the entre domain model, is built to solve the problem
 * of booking and tracking cargo. All important business rules for determining whether
 * or not a cargo is misdirected, what the current status of the cargo is (on board carrier,
 * in port etc), are captured in this aggregate.
